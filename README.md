# Hair-donations
I run an organization which collects hair donations to create wigs for children suffering from hair loss due to illness. I would like to create a system which will record all donations made.

## Spec
The full spec is included in the repo in the file called spec.sql.

## Deliverables
I will need the following files implemented for this repo. Further information for each one is included in the spec.
1. table.sql (create database and table)
2. sample-data.sql
3. reports.sql

## SQL Requirements
- Files should be able to run repeatedly
- Primary key
- Properly named columns
- Proper data types
- Appropriate, named constraints
