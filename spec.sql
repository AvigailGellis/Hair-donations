# Hair-donations
I started an organization in March 2015 which collects hair donations to create wigs for children suffering from hair loss due to illness. I would like to create a system which will record all donations made.
For each donation, I need to record:
- Donor's full name
- Hair color (3 general colors: brown, blonde, or red)
- Hair type (straight, curly, or wavy)
- Hair length (at least 12 inches)
I'd like to know which date each donation came in and keep track of whether it was used or not.

I will need the following reports:
1. How many donations are there that were not used yet for each color?
2. Do I have any unused donations 2 years or older?
3. Which hair type has been used most?

Q:Does the donor's name need to be unique?
A:No, there may be repeating donors.

Q:Do you ever know about a donation in advance?
A:Yes, but we only process it once we get the donation.

Sample Data:
Sarah, Cohen, blonde, wavy, 12, 3/16/19, not used
Rachel, Brown, brown, straight, 13, 1/7/24, not used
Jenny, Smith, brown, wavy, 12, 9/22/17, used
Lea, Lewis, red, curly, 11/11/23, used
Rebbeca, Jones, brown, straight, 12, 2/12/24, not used
